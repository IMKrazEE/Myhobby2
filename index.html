        <h2> I love to waveboard. Now I am a fan of it! It is a quite efficient way to travel in parks and best of all, it looks VERY COOL when someone is riding a waveboard with hands in his pocket. It all started one day, when my classmate came for a sleepover. I knew him since 7 years by then and I never knew that he knew how to waveboard. I looked from the balcony to see his car when he arrived but I saw something in his hand, something big. Then when he came upstairs, he showed me his waveboard and I was surprised to see how easily he could ride it. We practiced at night and he showed me a few basics, like the beginner way of riding it and how to get on to it without falling. Next day after he went home, I really really wanted a waveboard. We went and bought one. I was excited and practiced everyday. I skipped playing with friends in the park and practiced from 8:30 to 9:30 pm and in the morning 7:30 to 9 am. Eventually I learned to ride it in a week and now I can ride it easily. But there are a few things i need to improve like I am still using the beginner riding method. And no one is perfect. I REALLY REALLY LOVE TO WAVEBOARD!</h2>
